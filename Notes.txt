- Not sure we need the left/right child because we will input a tree directly :)
- Will try to run the Lero model and see how it works 
- Split the model into three different files
- Refactor the models so the training is in a seperate files
- Remove the use of the LeroModel so we only use LeroNet and Pairwise since we dont need a pointwise model (Should be done just needs testing)
- If we get the correct input we should easily be able to use the code LERO made 
- Still need to implement the listwise
